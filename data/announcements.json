Amendment to Blaine County Business Protocols, Procedures, and Penalties <https://www.nopixel.net/upload/index.php?posts/741369/>\n*Wording Alteration*\n\n\nThe original 14 day window to receive a response from the Mayor is too long when addressing a party that has been operating without a business license, given that they are required to obtain one within a 7 day window.\n\n\n*Original:* \"The Mayor's Office of Blaine County is tasked with the responsibility to communicate approval, denial, or requested alterations to your submitted proposal within 14 days of the submission.\"\n\n*Alteration:* \"The Mayor's Office of Blaine County is tasked with the responsibility to communicate approval, denial, or requested alterations to submitted proposal in an efficient and fair time frame.\"\n\n\n*New Section under \"Details\"*\n\nOperating without a Business License (see below)\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n*Legislation Including the Aforementioned Amendments:*\n\n\nThis legislation is intended to provide guidance for business protocols, laws, and enforcement within Blaine County.\n\n*Constitutional Justification*\n\nThe constitution provides no restrictions on the ability of a private citizen to conduct themselves or engage in commercial operations of a business. The constitution under Article II, Section 2 also empowers the Mayor of Blaine County to establish legislation, laws, procedures, and penalties pertaining to upstart and practices of businesses within its jurisdiction.\n\n*Details & Enforcement*\n\n*Business Proposal Procedure*\n\nThe citizens of San Andreas who seek to open and operate a business in Blaine County are responsible for proposing their intended business to the office of the Mayor of Blaine County via the business app. The submitter of the proposal must be the intended owner of the business, and must meet the following qualifications in order for their proposal to be considered:\n\n- No felonies, violent misdemeanors, or fraud on their criminal record\n\n\nThe business proposals will abide by the following guidelines or will be subject to denial:\n\n- State ID for identification and background check purposes.\n\n- Phone number of the owner for communication purposes.\n\n- The type of business and correct categorization of its goods or services.\n\n- The intended location of the business, which must be owned OR if you do not own the business yet, this may be updated in the future by citing an available property.\n\n\nThe Mayor's Office of Blaine County is tasked with the responsibility to communicate approval, denial, or requested alterations to submitted proposal in an efficient time frame.\n\nIf the business is approved, it is the responsibility of the submitter to seek the purchasing of a Business License as outlined in the Business License Protocols.\n\nIf the business is denied, the Blaine County Mayor's Office will communicate their concerns with the proposal. If they so choose, the submitter will then be allowed to submit a new or altered proposal at any time that addresses the concerns for reconsideration.\n\n* Business Penalties*\n\nShould a business owner that operates out of Blaine County be tried and found guilty in a court of law of having used their business for illegal activity, the business owner may be summoned to come before a panel in Blaine County to address what will become of their business. This panel will include the Mayor of Blaine County, one Justice/Judge, and the current Sheriff of Blaine County. The business owner will have the opportunity to plead their case to this panel, and the panel reserves the right to administer probation, fines, or seizures, if any, that they see fit.\n\n*Operating without a Business License*\n\nShould a citizen be found to be operating a business in Blaine County without a Business License, penalties will administered.\n\nThe following penalties will always be accompanied by a 7 day window between them. During this 7 day window, the offender will be expected to cease operations and obtain a Business License. Should they fail to obtain a Business License and continue operating, they will be penalized, and the next 7 day window will begin at the time of the penalty being issued.\n\nThe aforementioned penalties will escalate every 7 days, doubling the fine associated with the penalty each time. For example:\n\nFirst offense: Warning issued\nSecond offense: $25,000\nThird offense: $50,000\nFourth offense: $100,000\nFifth offense: $200,000\n\nThis will continue on until the offender ceases operations and obtains a Business License, or simply until they cease operations (if they choose not to pursue obtainment of a Business License).\n\n*Implementation Plan*\n\n*Timeline for Enactment:* Effective immediately.\n\n*Conclusion *\n\nThrough this legislation, citizens seeking to apply for, own, and operate businesses in Blaine County will be knowledgeable of the protocols, procedures, and penalties associated with that endeavor."

    "date": "2024-08-07",
    "url": "https://www.nopixel.net/upload/index.php?posts/741631/",
    "body": "Introduction\nHigh rates of speed have been a growing concern within Sandy Shores. Enacting 2 toll roads will help to slow down citizens driving through Sandy Shores, therefore keeping the residents and pedestrians safer, as well as contributing to the Blaine County Sheriff's Office's funds to support the growth of the department and, as a consequence, a safer Blaine County.\n\nConstitutional Justification\nAs per the Constitution, the Blaine County Mayor is responsible for the creation of Blaine County legislation and services, and the Blaine County Sheriff's Office is responsible for the County\u2019s public services. \n\nDetails\nTwo toll booths will be installed in Sandy Shores: One on East Joshua Road and one on Panorama Drive. These toll booths will be operated by members of the Blaine County Sheriff's Office. When a vehicle approaches the toll booth, they will come to a full stop and be charged with a $25.00 fee in order to pass. Should a citizens want easier entry, they will be allowed to purchase a Sandy Skip, which costs $500.00 and gains them quick passage through either toll road for 1 month.\n\nShould a citizen pass through the toll road without paying while it is being actively operated, and the citizen has been identified, they will incur a $25 fine to be paid at a later time. Each recurring time that the citizen passes without paying will incur another $25.\n\nIf a citizen drives through a toll road but the toll booth is not currently being operated, no toll will be applied for that passing.\n\nMembers of the Unified Police Department and members of the Emergency Medical Services are exempt from all tolls.\n\nImplementation\n\nTimeline for Enactment: Effective Immediately.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith the operation of these toll roads, Sandy Shores will become a safer place to live and visit while also helping to raise funds for a more well-equipped and productive Sheriff's Office.\n\nSignature\n\nAndi Jones\nMayor of Blaine County\nAugust 7, 2024"

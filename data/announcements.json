    "body": "High rates of speed have been a growing concern within Sandy Shores. Enacting 2 toll roads will help to slow down citizens driving through Sandy Shores, therefore keeping the residents and pedestrians safer, as well as contributing to the Blaine County Sheriff's Office's funds to support the growth of the department and, as a consequence, a safer Blaine County.\n\nConstitutional Justification\nAs per the Constitution, the Blaine County Mayor is responsible for the creation of Blaine County legislation and services, and the Blaine County Sheriff's Office is responsible for the County\u2019s public services. \n\nDetails\nTwo toll booths will be installed in Sandy Shores: One on East Joshua Road and one on Panorama Drive. These toll booths will be operated by members of the Blaine County Sheriff's Office. When a vehicle approaches the toll booth, they will come to a full stop and be charged with a $25.00 fee in order to pass. Should a citizens want easier entry, they will be allowed to purchase a Sandy Skip, which costs $500.00 and gains them quick passage through either toll road for 1 month.\n\nShould a citizen pass through the toll road without paying while it is being actively operated, and the citizen has been identified, they will incur a $25 fine to be paid at a later time. Each recurring time that the citizen passes without paying will incur another $25.\n\nIf a citizen drives through a toll road but the toll booth is not currently being operated, no toll will be applied for that passing.\n\nMembers of the Unified Police Department and members of the Emergency Medical Services are exempt from all tolls.\n\nImplementation\n\nTimeline for Enactment: Effective Immediately.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith the operation of these toll roads, Sandy Shores will become a safer place to live and visit while also helping to raise funds for a more well-equipped and productive Sheriff's Office.\n\nSignature\n\nAndi Jones\nMayor of Blaine County\nAugust 7, 2024"
